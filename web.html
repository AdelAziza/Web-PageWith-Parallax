            <p>My name is <i>Adel Aziza Useni.</i><br><br>
            Staring in winter 2017 my academic journey in Information and Technology, 
            I keep working hard to increase my knowledge to be an expert on what I like to do be in the future. 
            My goal was to finish my four years at BC and later to transfer to Washington University to have my master degree. I took different steps to reach my goals. 
            First, I used various resources on campus to keep learning and share with students who have more experience than me on certain subjects. 
            Since everyday technology is getting better, it was essential to keep learning every day. For example, I often talked to my professor who giva me some subjection on how to be an expert and increase knowledge which was having time to practice. Second, by getting involved in  different organizations that use data and technology to practice and increase more knowledge, it helped to have to reinforce my experience and to have a clear view on how I can be able to use what I learned at my workplace.</p>

            <h1>My Passion for technology</h1>
        </div>
                <p>Since I was a little girl, I usually want to be the first girl to have high education in my family. Coming from a culture where women are born to get married and give children, it has been a challenge for me to travel and be educated. However, my parents are working hard so that I can have a better education and encourage me to achieve my goals.  I finished my high school in 2015. Although the tradition believes about women, I want to distinguish myself in my community by having a degree in Web development and become a teacher of programming that are the career goals that I want to obtain.
                I came from a country where I did not have the chance to learn how to use and manipulate computers, so I became interested in learning how computers work. I started by having a part-time during a vacation at my father’s school as a receptionist. Even though it was challenging at the beginning, but it helped to build confidence in me. Through that experience increase my desire to learn about computers and learn to be an expert female. It was challenging to learn from high school how to use a computer, so I learned from the internet.

                <p>
                    Many girls in my community did not work to school even going finishing high school. However, one of my cousins was able to attend high school, but when she was in 10th Grade, her parents were not able to pay for her education. She had no other choice than staying at home and taking care of her siblings. However, her parents were working hard to found money for her education. After weeks, my cousin decided to get married at 17 years old. I was devastating, confused and frustrated because I was ten years old and I was worried about my situation because we were 8 in my family.  I knew how tuitions were expensive. It was regrettable for all of us who were looking to her as a big sister who could have been a mentor for all of us. Despite the high cost of tuition, my parents were able to pay for all of us. That experience was a reinforcement on my determination on achieving my dreams which is to be an independent woman who can be an example for other girls who continue to struggle on how to execute their purposes. It motivates me to study something that I can use in the future to help others by being a professor. I learned from that experience that it is still possible to create other alternative ways to achieve your goals. It is better to suffer now for a short period of time in order to have a mindset to continue fighting for your dreams to be a reality.  
Spring 2017, I took a programming class, and it was my first time to code. It was challenging for me to translate each word the teacher was saying in my native language for a better understanding. I was timid in the class due to my lack of vocabulary in English, and I was not able to ask questions to my professor. As a consequent, I failed to the first project with a D. I was a disappointment to myself. My professor emailed me and asked me if I could have time to meet with him. I was scared and did not know what to tell him about my performance on the exam. I took the courage to meet him, and the discussion helped me realize that I was surrounded by many supports that I can use to be successful. I guided me to the Academic Success Center where they are tutors who can help me to understand other concepts since sometimes in class we did not have enough time. After, two weeks of hard work and meeting once a week with my professor after class helped me to understand better. On the second exam, I had an A, and I was proud of myself. I learned that with hard work and determination, you could achieve your goals. It is essential to learn from a failure to avoid making the same mistakes in the future.

            <h1>What bais that people may have while majoring in majoring in Information and technology</h1>
        </div>
            <p>
                Many people thought that when you are majoring in Information and technology, you do not need to have good communication skill. But it necessary to learn how to communicate with people and ask questions to enhance your knowledge. I have noticed that I still need to improve how to socialize professionally. For instance, my professor invited a director of a Microsoft in class, but I did not prepare a card that I could give him so that we could keep in contact.  As a result, he came only one day, and I did not have the opportunity to talk to him about his experience. I realized that I need to learn every day and continue improving my strength. I decided to take a communication class 250 communication in a Diverse Workplace that thought how you should prepare and how to socialize in different occasion especially when you want to enter the professional world.

                    How I give back to our community?</h1>

            <p>
                I contribute to the well-being of the community by participating on January 20 to the Women’s March to be inspired by women who support equal rights between men and women. As a woman, it is important to encourage women who are fighting for the benefit of a community to be similar. Because I came from a culture where women are not treated equally than men, so it is essential for me to stead up and let my voice heard to help other who still struggling with the inequality between men and women. I contribute by cleaning Robinswood Community Park with the BC stuff on March 8, 2019, to keep our city clean.
